  My task is to develop this landing page and make it look as much like the design as I can.

  This project focuses mostly on HTML, CSS and layouts with CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!

 This project primarily focuses on HTML, CSS, and CSS layouts. A small amount of JS is present for the toggle for mobile navigation.

  The Outcome of this project is to:


  - View the site's ideal layout based on the size of their device's screen.

  - View the hover states of each of the page's interactive elements.


  - More information about the project will be available in the "README.md" file. You can find information on colours, fonts, etc. in the "style-guide.html" file.
  - And to share my submissions with the community to get feedback.
